## üéØ Project Goals

This project was developed with several key learning objectives in mind:

* To create a practical, functional tool capable of accurately validating diverse US phone number formats.
* To gain a deeper understanding and practical experience with **regular expressions (regex)** for advanced string pattern matching.
* To practice core **DOM manipulation** techniques in JavaScript, effectively interacting with HTML elements and dynamically updating the user interface.
* To build a complete, albeit simple, front-end application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reinforcing foundational web development skills.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Formats

The validator is designed to recognize and accept the following valid US phone number formats:

* `1 555-555-5555`
* `1 (555) 555-5555`

## üí° Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for potential improvements or expansions for this project:

* **International Support:** Extend the validation logic to include phone number formats from other countries.
* **Live Feedback:** Implement real-time validation or more immediate visual cues (e.g., green/red input borders) as the user types.
* **Detailed Error Messages:** Provide more specific feedback for invalid numbers (e.g., "Missing area code," "Incorrect country code").
* **Clipboard Integration:** Add a feature to copy a valid, formatted number to the clipboard.
* **Framework Integration:** Explore rebuilding the application using a modern front-end framework (like React, Vue, or Angular) to leverage component-based architecture.
